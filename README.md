# django-nonrel sandboxes

It's about the fun.

It's also about exclusion

(ignoring files and <dir>)

on github.

The work starts with this:

http://django-mongodb-engine.readthedocs.org/en/latest/topics/setup.html

The installation and setup id django@nonrel-1.5 @

git+https://github.com/django-nonrel/django@nonrel-1.5

However, there are also django@nonrel versions 1.6 and 1.7 at this time...

At https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.5/ it says 1.5 is "an insecure version of Django that is no longer supported. Please upgrade to a newer release!"

I wasn't able to python manage.py runserver cleanly, without errors, for the more recent versions of Django. I tried, as a last resort, Django 1.5 and it worked like it's supposed to.

I want to play with Django and Mongodb. I also want to sort out why the more recent versions are having issues. I presume because they are newer and the errors tracked back to be located, or begun, in a migration folder. Perhaps this s because the toolbox and the Mongo-engine were not updated as recently as Django's more recent versions.

I also want to play with virtualenv with and without the option of --system-site-packages, for "virtual environment access to the global site-packages" or local folders of the required things.

Remember, this is fun when you figure it out!
